A modular web vulnerability scanner built as part of the Infosys Springboard Internship.  
The project is divided into milestones, each milestone focusing on different aspects of building a security testing tool.

## Project Goals
- Develop a custom web application security scanner.
- Implement crawling, metadata extraction, and automated vulnerability tests.
- Learn secure coding practices and mitigation techniques.

## Structure
- **Milestone 1**: Project Initialization and Target Scanning
  - Week 1: Environment setup, exploring DVWA/Juice Shop/bWAPP.
  - Week 2: Developed a custom crawler to discover pages, links, and forms.

Future milestones will add SQL Injection testing, XSS testing, and automated reporting.
