WebScanPro is a modular web vulnerability scanner built as part of the Infosys Springboard Internship.  
The project is divided into milestones, each focusing on different aspects of building a security testing tool.

## Project Goals
- Develop a custom web application security scanner.
- Implement modules for crawling, metadata extraction, and vulnerability testing.
- Learn secure coding practices and mitigation techniques.

## Structure
- **Milestone 1: Project Initialization and Target Scanning**
  - Week 1: Environment setup and exploring vulnerable applications (DVWA, Juice Shop, bWAPP).
  - Week 2: Implemented a custom crawler to discover pages, links, and forms.
- **Future Milestones**
  - SQL Injection Testing
  - XSS Testing
