Week 2: Target Scanning Module

- Implemented a custom crawler in Python.
- The crawler automatically discovers:
  - Web pages and internal links
  - Input fields and forms
- Used BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content.
- Saved extracted metadata into `target_metadata.json` for future testing modules.
- Tested crawler against sample site (Books to Scrape) and verified correct link & form extraction.
