Week 2: Target Scanning Module

- Implemented a custom Python crawler (`crawler.py`).
- The crawler automatically:
  - Extracts all internal links.
  - Identifies and saves forms with their actions, methods, and input fields.
- Used `requests` for fetching pages and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML.
- Implemented normalization of URLs and domain filtering to stay within scope.
- Saved extracted data into `target_metadata.json` for future modules.
- Verified functionality on the website "Books to Scrape".
