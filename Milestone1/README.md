# Milestone 1: Project Initialization and Target Scanning

This milestone focused on laying the foundation of the WebScanPro project.  
It was divided into two weeks:

## Week 1: Project Initialization and Setup
- Defined project goals and outcomes.
- Set up vulnerable web applications (DVWA, Juice Shop, bWAPP) using XAMPP or Docker.
- Explored the structure, functionality, and possible security flaws of the target applications.

## Week 2: Target Scanning Module
- Developed a **custom Python crawler** to:
  - Discover internal pages and links.
  - Identify forms and input fields.
- Used **BeautifulSoup** for parsing HTML.
- Saved metadata in JSON format for future testing modules.
- Successfully tested crawler on [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com).
