Week 1: Project Initialization and Setup

- Defined the project scope: building a modular web vulnerability scanner.
- Installed and configured vulnerable applications:
  - DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
  - Juice Shop
  - bWAPP
- Explored their login flows, input fields, and navigation structure.
- Identified potential weak points for testing in later modules (e.g., forms, URL parameters).
