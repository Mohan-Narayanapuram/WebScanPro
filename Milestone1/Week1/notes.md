# Week 1 Notes

## Objective
To understand the project scope and set up the environment with vulnerable applications.

## Key Learnings
- Vulnerable web apps (DVWA, Juice Shop, bWAPP) are used for practicing security testing safely.
- These applications intentionally include flaws like SQL Injection, XSS, and weak authentication.
- They provide an isolated environment to test automated scanners without affecting real websites.

## Outcome
By the end of Week 1:
- The environment was set up and running.
- We explored login pages, forms, and basic workflows.
- Identified test points for upcoming modules.
